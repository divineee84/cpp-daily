# cpp-daily
A daily log of me figuring out C++. Every folder has a little code and a little context — what I learned, where I messed up, or what finally clicked. It’s not polished, but it’s real. The idea is simple: show up, code a bit, and keep pushing forward until all the small steps turn into something big.
